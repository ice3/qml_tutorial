=============
A functionnality is changed on each commit, with commentaries in both the code and the commit message. 

You can use "git log --oneline  -U1 --word-diff" to see the differences of each version. 

Or use a graphical tool such as gitk or tig to navigate between the diff and the file state for each commit.
